      content: 'I was raised in the beaches of Puerto Rico, and because of that, now that I\'m older I\'ve had a couple of skin cancers removed. My dermatologist had recommended using pure zinc oxide sunscreen only, but they pretty much left me looking like a mime. I found JACKET, and this was a blessing! It\'s a strong sunscreen, doesn\'t feel oily, and doesn\'t leave any white residue on my face, even though it has a good zinc oxide content. It\'s 4 ounces, which allows me to bring it with me when I travel. And the fact that it has age spot remover is a bonus! I highly recommend it and will continue using it.',
